# Controls
Player moves with keys A, W, S, D and points its gun by moving the mouse and shoots by clicking on canvas.

# Cool bits of the code
The game uses **vectors** to rotate the player to mouse position in canvas and get the next position of enemies and bullets.

In order to make the enemies move towards the player, player's position is passed to enemies in every frame.

# What's next?
**Cool retro games need bosses**, it would be nice if player had to fight a big fat bug at the end of the game.
Also could be more interesting if the player could **move relative to the mouse position** instead of moving relative to the canvas.

Another cool possible feature could be **power ups** or **new guns**.
